    <h3>Brown Butter Cookies</h3>
    <p>These cookies are some of the best i've come across. Browning the butter gives it a rich, nutty flavor. The high ratio of brown sugar alongside the yogurt ensures they stay moist</p>
    <p>Just make sure you add all the wet ingredients at the right time- i forgot to add the yogurt until after the dough was formed last time and they didn't come out right</p>
